# Bikesharing

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make a citi bike trip analysis. First we will use Pandas to change the tripduration column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then we create a set of visualization to 

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, weâ€™ll add these new visualizations  for our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

The project consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present our results. We will submit the following:

* Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
* Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
* Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

### Results

The results of the visualizations are shown below:

#### Before starting the analysis, it helps to know where the popular staring locations are. This will help understand the trends in NYC.

#### The map showing the end locations. This will help us understan d where user usually like to travel.

#### A line chart displaying the no of minutes for the user. This can help determine how long user like to ride.

#### The heat map gives us a detail understanding by showing the number of trips user have taken with a day to rest of the week.

#### A gender heat map gives more demographics about the bike trip within a week.

#### The chart shows the bike sharing trends between customer and subscribers. It also includes the gender breakdown.

### Summary 

After the analysis and visualization we can say that manu users are using bike in the NYC area. We can also infer that most of the user are in the mornings and evenings. With this information we can say that these could be people who might be working and they use bike to commute for work. There might be some tourists too. Also most of the user are males and also some of the user gender is unknown. This information can help us to shhow to the investors. 

We could also do some other visualizations that could help for future analysis:

* We can have analysis with the user birth year, where we can determine which age group uses the most bike.
* We should also do analysis with the station names, so that we can know which area is popular. 

This kind of information would be very beneficial for us.
